<p>The CMS experiment is 21 m long, 15 m wide and 15 m high, and sits in
a cavern that could contain all the residents of Geneva; albeit not
comfortably. The detector is like a giant filter, where each layer is
designed to stop, track or measure a different type of particle emerging
from proton-proton and heavy ion collisions. Finding the energy and
momentum of a particle gives clues to its identity, and particular
patterns of particles or “signatures” are indications of new and
exciting physics</p>
<figure><img src="fig/cms_160312_02.png" style="width:100.0%" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p><em>Above: A schematic view of the CMS detector.</em></p>
<p>The detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. This takes the
form of a cylindrical coil of superconducting cable, cooled to -268.5oC,
that generates a magnetic field of 4 Tesla, about 100,000 times that of
the Earth.</p>
<p>Detectors consist of layers of material that exploit the different
properties of particles to catch and measure the energy and momentum of
each one. CMS needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>a high performance system to detect and measure muons,</li>
<li>a high resolution method to detect and measure electrons and photons
(an electromagnetic calorimeter),</li>
<li>a high quality central tracking system to give accurate momentum
measurements, and</li>
<li>a “hermetic” hadron calorimeter, designed to entirely surround the
collision and prevent particles from escaping.</li>
</ul>
<p>Particles emerging from collisions first meet a tracker, made
entirely of silicon, that charts their positions as they move through
the detector, allowing us to measure their momentum. Outside the tracker
are calorimeters that measure the energy of particles. In measuring the
momentum, the tracker should interfere with the particles as little as
possible, whereas the calorimeters are specifically designed to stop the
particles in their tracks.</p>
<p>The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) - made of lead tungstate, a
very dense material that produces light when hit – measures the energy
of photons and electrons whereas the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) is
designed principally to detect any particle made up of quarks (the basic
building blocks of protons and neutrons). The size of the magnet allows
the tracker and calorimeters to be placed inside its coil, resulting in
an overall compact detector.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, CMS is also designed to measure muons. The
outer part of the detector, the iron magnet “return yoke”, confines the
magnetic field and stops all remaining particles except for muons and
neutrinos. The muon tracks are measured by four layers of muon detectors
that are interleaved with the iron yoke. The neutrinos escape from CMS
undetected, although their presence can be indirectly inferred from the
“missing transverse energy” in the event.</p>
<p>Within the LHC, bunches of particles collide up to 40 million times
per second, so a “trigger” system that saves only potentially
interesting events is essential. This reduces the number recorded from
one billion to around 100 per second.</p>

</h3>
<p>Measuring the momentum of particles is crucial in helping us to build
up a picture of events at the heart of the collision. One method to
calculate the momentum of a particle is to track its path through a
magnetic field; the more curved the path, the less momentum the particle
had. The CMS tracker records the paths taken by charged particles by
finding their positions at a number of key points.</p>
<p>The tracker can reconstruct the paths of high-energy muons, electrons
and hadrons as well as see tracks coming from the decay of very
short-lived particles such as beauty or “b quarks” that will be used to
study the differences between matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>The tracker needs to record particle paths accurately yet be
lightweight so as to disturb the particle as little as possible. It does
this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be
reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each
measurement is accurate to 10 µm, a fraction of the width of a human
hair. It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives
the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were
therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.</p>
<p>The final design consists of a tracker made entirely of silicon: the
pixels, at the very core of the detector and dealing with the highest
intensity of particles, and the silicon microstrip detectors that
surround it. As particles travel through the tracker the pixels and
microstrips produce tiny electric signals that are amplified and
detected. The tracker employs sensors covering an area the size of a
tennis court, with 75 million separate electronic read-out channels: in
the pixel detector there are some 6000 connections per square
centimetre.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="pixels">Pixels<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pixels"></a>
</h3>
<p>The pixel detector, though only about the size of a small suitcase,
contains 124 million pixels, allowing it to track the paths of particles
emerging from the collision with extreme accuracy. It is also the
closest detector to the beam pipe, with cylindrical layers roughly at
3cm, 7cm, 11cm and 16cm and disks at either end, and so will be vital in
reconstructing the tracks of very short-lived particles.</p>
<p>Each of the four layers is composed of individual silicon modules,
splitted into little silicon sensors, like tiny kitchen tiles: the
pixels. Each of these silicon pixels is 100µm by 150µm, about two hairs
widths. When a charged particle passes through a pixel, it gives enough
energy to eject the electrons from silicon atoms. A voltage applied to
the sensor allows collecting these charges as a small electric signal,
which is amplified by an electronic readout chip (for a total of 16
chips per module).</p>
<figure><img src="fig/Pixelement.gif" alt="A schematic of a pixel detector." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">A schematic of a pixel detector.</div>
</figure><p>Knowing which pixels have been touched allows us to deduce the
particle’s trajectory. And because the detector is made of 2D tiles and
has four layers, we can create a three-dimensional picture.</p>
<p>However, being so close to the collision means that the number of
particles passing through is huge: the rate of particles received at 3cm
from the beamline is around 600 million particles per square centimetre
per second! The pixel detector is able to disentangle and reconstruct
all the tracks particles leave behind, and withstand such a pummeling
over the duration of the experiment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="strips">Strips<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#strips"></a>
</h3>
<p>After the pixels and on their way out of the tracker, particles pass
through ten layers of silicon strip detectors, reaching out to a radius
of 130 centimetres.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/CMS_photo_3_courtesy_of_CERN.jpg" style="width:75.0%" alt="Silicon strips in the tracker barrel." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Silicon strips in the tracker barrel.</div>
</figure><p>The silicon strip detector (see the figure below) consists of four
inner barrel (TIB) layers assembled in shells with two inner endcaps
(TID), each composed of three small discs. The outer barrel (TOB) –
surrounding both the TIB and the TID – consists of six concentric
layers. Finally two endcaps (TEC) close off the tracker on either end.
Each has silicon modules optimised differently for its place within the
detector.</p>

tracker (contained within the ECAL barrel and endcaps) looking
perpendicular to the beam pipe.</div>
</figure><p>This part of the tracker contains 15,200 highly sensitive modules
with a total of about 10 million detector strips read by 72,000
microelectronic chips. Each module consists of three elements: one or
two silicon sensors, its mechanical support structure and readout
electronics.</p>
<p>The silicon detectors work in much the same way as the pixels: as a
charged particle crosses the material it knocks electrons from atoms
giving a very small pulse of current lasting a few nanoseconds. This
small amount of charge is then amplified by Analogue Pipeline Voltage
(APV25) chips, giving us “hits” when a particle passes, allowing us to
reconstruct its path. Four or six such chips are housed within a
“hybrid”, which also contains electronics to monitor key sensor
information, such as temperature, and provide timing information in
order to match “hits” with collisions.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<figure><img src="fig/cms_ecal.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The energies of electrons and photons are measured using the CMS
electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). Measuring their energies with the
necessary precision in the very strict conditions of the LHC - a high
magnetic field, high levels of radiation, and only 25 nanoseconds
between collisions - requires dedicated detector materials.</p>
<p>Lead tungstate crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than
stainless steel, but with a touch of oxygen in this crystalline form, it
is highly transparent and “scintillates” when electrons and photons pass
through it. This means it produces light in proportion to the impinging
particle’s energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast,
short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast, and
fairly compact detector.</p>
<p>The ECAL, made up of a “barrel” section and two “endcaps”, forms a
layer between the tracker and the HCAL. The cylindrical barrel consists
of 61,200 crystals formed into 36 “supermodules”, each weighing around
three tonnes and containing 1700 crystals. The flat endcaps seal off the
barrel at each end and are made up of almost 15,000 more crystals.</p>
<p>Photodetectors, which have been especially designed to work within
the high magnetic field, are glued onto the back of each of the crystals
to detect the scintillation light and convert it to an electrical signal
that is amplified and sent for analysis. Avalanche photodiodes or APDs
are used in the the crystal barrel, and vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) for
the endcaps.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ECALcrystals_0.jpg" style="width:75.0%" alt="Lead tungstate crystals. One can see an APD attached to the end of one of the crystals at the bottom of the image." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Lead tungstate crystals. One can see an APD

</figure><p>For extra spatial precision, the ECAL also contains a preshower
detector that sits in front of the endcaps. These allow CMS to
distinguish between single high-energy photons (often signs of exciting
physics) and the less interesting close pairs of low-energy photons.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<figure><img src="fig/cms_hcal.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) measures the energy of “hadrons”,
particles made of quarks and gluons (for example protons, neutrons,
pions and kaons). Additionally it provides indirect measurement of the
presence of non-interacting, uncharged particles such as neutrinos.</p>
<p>Measuring these particles is important as they can tell us if new
particles such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric particles (much
heavier versions of the standard particles we know) have been formed. As
these particles decay they may produce new particles that do not leave
record of their presence in any part of the CMS detector. To spot these
the HCAL must be “hermetic”, that is make sure it captures, to the
extent possible, every particle emerging from the collisions. This way
if we see particles shoot out one side of the detector, but not the
other, with an imbalance in the momentum and energy (measured in the
sideways “transverse” direction relative to the beam line), we can
deduce that we’re producing “invisible” particles.</p>
<p>To ensure that we’re seeing something new, rather than just letting
familiar particles escape undetected, layers of the HCAL were built in a
staggered fashion so that there are no gaps in direct lines that a
familiar particle might escape through.</p>
<p>The HCAL is a sampling calorimeter [see explanation below] meaning it
finds a particle’s position, energy and arrival time using alternating
layers of “absorber” and fluorescent “scintillator” materials that
produce a rapid light pulse when the particle passes through. Special
optic fibres collect up this light and feed it into readout boxes where
photodetectors amplify the signal. When the amount of light in a given
region is summed up over many layers of tiles in depth, called a
“tower”, this total amount of light is a measure of a particle’s energy.
As the HCAL is massive and thick, fitting it into “compact” CMS was a
challenge, as the cascades of particles produced when a hadron hits the
dense absorber material (known as showers) are large, and the minimum
amount of material needed to contain and measure them is about one
metre.</p>
<p>To accomplish this feat, the HCAL is organised into barrel (HB and
HO), endcap (HE) and forward (HF) sections. There are 36 barrel
“wedges”, each weighing 26 tonnes. These form the last layer of detector
inside the magnet coil whilst a few additional layers, the outer barrel
(HO), sit outside the coil, ensuring no energy leaks out the back of the
HB undetected. Similarly, 36 endcap wedges measure particle energies as
they emerge through the ends of the solenoid magnet.</p>
<p>Lastly, the two hadronic forward calorimeters (HF) are positioned at
either end of CMS, to pick up the myriad particles coming out of the
collision region at shallow angles relative to the beam line. These
receive the bulk of the particle energy contained in the collision so
must be very resistant to radiation and use different materials to the
other parts of the HCAL.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/Figure_001.png" alt="A schematic view of the HCAL detectors, looking “from the side”, perpendicular to the beam pipe." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">A schematic view of the HCAL detectors, looking
“from the side”, perpendicular to the beam pipe.</div>
</figure><p>The CMS barrel and endcap sampling calorimeters are made of repeating
layers of dense absorber and tiles of plastic scintillator. When a
hadronic particle hits a plate of absorber, in this case brass or steel,
an interaction can occur producing numerous secondary particles. As
these secondary particles flow through successive layers of absorber
they too can interact and a cascade or “shower” of particles results. As
this shower develops, the particles pass through the alternating layers
of active scintillation material causing them to emit blue-violet light.
Within each tile tiny optical “wavelength-shifting fibres”, with a
diameter of less than 1mm, absorb this light. These shift the
blue-violet light into the green region of the spectrum, and clear optic
cables then carry the green light away to readout boxes located at
strategic locations within the HCAL volume.</p>
<p>A megatile is a layer of tiles whose sizes depend on their spatial
location and orientation relative to the collision, chosen so that each
receives roughly the same number of particles. Optic fibres fit into
grooves cut into the individual tiles. Because the light picked up gives
a measure of energy, the gaps between tiles must be filled with a
reflective paint to ensure that light produced in each tile cannot
escape into others and vice versa.</p>

built, with a 4 Tesla magnetic field that is 100,000 times stronger than
the Earth’s.</p>
<p>Its job is to bend the paths of particles emerging from high-energy
collisions in the LHC. The more momentum a particle has the less its
path is curved by the magnetic field, so tracing its path gives a
measure of momentum. CMS began with the aim of having the strongest
magnet possible because a higher strength field bends paths more and,
combined with high-precision position measurements in the tracker and
muon detectors, this allows accurate measurement of the momentum of even
high-energy particles.</p>
<p>The CMS magnet is a “solenoid” - a magnet made of coils of wire that
produce a uniform magnetic field when electricity flows through them.
The CMS magnet is “superconducting”, allowing electricity to flow
without resistance and creating a powerful magnetic field. In fact at
ordinary temperatures the strongest possible magnet has only half the
strength of the CMS solenoid.</p>
<p>The tracker and calorimeter detectors (ECAL and HCAL) fit snugly
inside the magnet coil whilst the muon detectors are interleaved with a
12-sided iron structure that surrounds the magnet coils and contains and
guides the field. Made up of three layers this “return yoke” reaches out
14 metres in diameter and also acts as a filter, allowing through only
muons and weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. The enormous
magnet also provides most of the experiment’s structural support, and
must be very strong itself to withstand the forces of its own magnetic
field.</p>

</h3>
<p>As the name “Compact Muon Solenoid” suggests, detecting muons is one
of CMS’s most important tasks. Muons are charged particles that are just
like electrons and positrons, but are 200 times heavier.</p>
<p>Because muons can penetrate several metres of iron without
interacting, unlike most particles they are not stopped by any of CMS’s
calorimeters. Therefore, chambers to detect muons are placed at the very
edge of the experiment where they are the only particles likely to
register a signal.</p>
<p>A particle is measured by fitting a curve to hits among the four muon
stations, which sit outside the magnet coil and are interleaved with
iron “return yoke” plates (shown in red below, for the barrel region).
By tracking its position through the multiple layers of each station,
combined with tracker measurements the detectors precisely trace a
particle’s path. This gives a measurement of its momentum because we
know that particles travelling with more momentum bend less in a
magnetic field. As a consequence, the CMS magnet is very powerful so we
can bend even the paths of very high-energy muons and calculate their
momenta.</p>
<p>In total there are 1400 muon chambers: 250 drift tubes (DTs) and 540
cathode strip chambers (CSCs) track the particles’ positions and provide
a trigger, while 610 resistive plate chambers (RPCs) form a redundant
trigger system, which quickly decides to keep the acquired muon data or
not. Because of the many layers of detector and different specialities
of each type, the system is naturally robust and able to filter out
background noise.</p>
<p>DTs and RPCs are arranged in concentric cylinders around the beam
line (“the barrel region”) whilst CSCs and RPCs, make up the “endcaps”
disks that cover the ends of the barrel.</p>

<p><em>Above left: Installation of a wheel of drift tubes. Right: Event
display of two muons seen in CMS with matching drift tubes.</em></p>
<p>The drift tube (DT) system measures muon positions in the barrel part
of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a
gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the
volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the
electric field ending up at the positively-charged wire.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/dt_design.png" style="width:75.0%" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram,
the wires are going into the page) as well as by calculating the muon’s
original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance
and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by
the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon’s position.</p>
<p>Each DT chamber, on average 2m x 2.5m in size, consists of 12
aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each up with up to
60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction
parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the
perpendicular coordinate.</p>

<h3 id="cathode-strip-chambers">Cathode Strip Chambers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cathode-strip-chambers"></a>
</h3>
<p>Cathode strip chambers (CSC) are used in the endcap disks where the
magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/oreach-2005-011.jpg" style="width:75.0%" alt="Installed CSCs." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Installed CSCs.</div>

matching CSCs (in red).</div>
</figure><p>CSCs consist of arrays of positively-charged “anode” wires crossed
with negatively-charged copper “cathode” strips within a gas volume.
When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which
flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive
ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also
inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire
direction.</p>
<p>Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two
position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing
precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the
CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains
six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their
tracks to those in the tracker.</p>

<p><em>Above: The positions of the RPCs in the barrel and endcaps

<p>RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively-charged anode and a
negatively-charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity plastic
material and separated by a gas volume.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/RPClayers.jpg" alt="The layers of an RPC" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The layers of an RPC</div>
</figure><p>When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of
gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing an avalanche
of electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the
electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips
after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a
quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to
make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs
combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one
nanosecond (one billionth of a second).</p>
